        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
        <p> RML (RDF Mapping Language) is an extension of R2RML that was <a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1184/ldow2014_paper_01.pdf">intially proposed in 2014 by Anastasia Dimou et al.</a>, proving a way to generate RDF graphs from data formats beyond RDB. 
          Other extension were also proposed to declare transformation functions within the mappings (<a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1593/article-13.pdf">R2RML-F</a> proposed by Christophe Debruyne and Declan O'Sullivan), or to generate RDF graphs from non-relational databases (<a href="https://hal.science/hal-01066663v5">xR2RML</a> by Franck Michel et al.).
          Among all these extensions, RML has become quite popular, with currently <a href="https://github.com/kg-construct/awesome-kgc-tools?tab=readme-ov-file#kgc-materializers">more than 8 implementations</a> widely used in industry and academic projects.
          The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/kg-construct/">Knowledge Graph Construction W3C Community Group</a> was formed in 2019 to <a href="https://github.com/kg-construct/rml-questions/discussions">gather feedback</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kg-construct/use-cases">use-cases</a>, and explore how to merge all extension in one integrated specification maintaining backwards compatilibity with R2RML.  </p>
        <!--<p><i class="todo">Background of landscape, technology, and relationship to the Web, users, developers, implementers, and industry.</i></p>-->
      </div>

      <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p> The scope of this Working Group is to define a declarative language for the construction of RDF graphs from heterogeneous data sources. Building on the foundational concepts of R2RML, RML provides a complementary specification, designed to support mappings from a wide variety of (semi-)structured data formats into RDF. Beyond data formats, RML also provides support for new features: i) flexible declaration of input and output formats; ii) declarative description of transformation functions; iii) enable the generation of RDF Collections & Containers; and iv) declaration of views over any kind of data format for complex data pipelines.   </p>
        
        <p> The Knowledge Graph Construction Community Group has identified, in <a href="https://w3id.org/rml/portal">its final report</a>, a set of modules that together constitute the complete RML specification. Each module comprises a distinct set of RDF-related features and can be implemented independently. 
          The Working Group may however reconsider this and proceed differently from the Community Group's proposal. The Working Group will also consider <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#allow-new-features">allowing new features</a> in these recommendations, according to <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#revised-rec-features">Section 6.3.11.4 of the W3C process</a>, in order to render future evolutions easier.</p>

        <p>The group MUST ensure that any R2RML mapping can be expressed as a valid RML mapping, and that any RML mapping restricted to the R2RML feature set can be translated back into a valid R2RML mapping.</p>


        <section id="section-out-of-scope">
          <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
            <p>The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this Working group.</p>

            <ul class="out-of-scope">
              <li>Adding extensions or new features to R2RML or Direct Mapping. These two recommendations will remain stable, without incorporating new features or deprecating any of the existing ones. </li>
            </ul>

          Deliverables

        <p>Updated document status is available on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/rml/publications/">group publication status page</a>.</p>

        <p><i>Draft state</i> indicates the state of the deliverable at the time of the charter approval. <i>Expected completion</i> indicates when the deliverable is projected to become a Recommendation, or otherwise reach a stable state.</p>

          <h3>
            Normative Specifications
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Working Group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt id="web-foo" class="spec">RML-Core: RDF Mapping Language - Core </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>This specification defines the principal characteristics of the language, generalizing and refining R2RML; the rest of specifications build on top of it.
                RML-Core consists of almost the same concepts as the R2RML, but redefines them to distinguish them from the R2RML counterparts. It also incoporates new features missing
                in R2RML such the dynamic generation of language tags or datatypes. In case RDF 1.2 becomes a W3C Recommendation and standardize the use of triple
                terms (i.e., RDF triples used as objects in other triples), RML-Core will ensure full compliance with RDF 1.2.</p>

    <!-- Testing and interop -->
	  <p>In order to advance to 
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each normative specification is expected to have 
		  <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent interoperable
			  implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification, where
interoperability can be verified by passing open test suites. In order to advance to
Proposed Recommendation, each normative specification must have an open
test suite of every feature defined in the specification.</p>
	  <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
    <!--<p><span class='todo'>Consider adopting a healthy testing policy, such as:</span> 
      To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications 
      in Candidate Recommendation 
      or to features that have deployed implementations
      should have <a href='https://www.w3.org/2019/02/testing-policy.html'>tests</a>.  
      Testing efforts should be conducted via the <a href="https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt">Web Platform Tests</a> project.</p>-->

    <!-- Horizontal review -->

     <!--<p>Each specification should contain sections detailing all known security and
      privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>-->

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

      <!--	<p class="todo">In addition to the above catch-all reference to horizontal review which includes accessibility review, please check with chairs and staff contacts of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group</a> to determine if an additional liaison statement with more specific information about concrete review issues is needed in the list below.</p>-->

        <p>
          To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the

        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#confidentiality-levels">public</a>: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about the group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the <a class="todo" href=""> RML Working Group home page.</a>

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">W3C Process Document (section 5.2.1, Consensus)</a>. Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email, GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from <span id='cfc'> one week to 10 working days</span>, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.
